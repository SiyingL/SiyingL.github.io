# Welcome!

I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Eudaimonia Institute and Economics Department, Wake Forest University. I received my M.A. and Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Virginia in 2018. Currently, I am working at the intersection of health economics, industrial organization and public health.

My research seeks to understand the decision-making process of patients, physicians and health care providers, and evaluate how market competition in the health care market affects the accessibility to care, the quality of care and patients' welfare. My job market paper builds and estimates an interactive game to examine the hospitals' outpatient surgery quality choices when facing emerging competition from ambulatory surgery centers. I find that, when ASCs are encouraged to enter the market by higher Medicare reimbursement rates, hospitals invest in their quality levels to compete with ASCs and deter ASCs from entering the market. Patients benefit from intensified competition.


I also work in the field of public health and published two papers with my coauthors (at Maternal and Child Nutrition and American Journal of Preventive Medicine, respectively). Please see my research page for details on these publications and other ongoing projects.
I will be available for interviews at the January 2020 ASSA meetings in San Diego.
