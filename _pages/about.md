# Welcome!

I am a postdoctoral research scholar at the Eudaimonia Institute and Economics Department, Wake Forest University. 

I attended Wuhan University, China, double-majoring in Economics and Mathematics. I received my M.A. and Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Virginia. My primary research focuses on health economics and industrial organization. In particular, I am interested in if and how competition can lead to lower prices, and higher quality in the healthcare market. Additionally, I study how we can achieve better health outcomes through other channels such as reducing air pollution, promoting breastfeeding and preventing unnecessary opioid prescription.

**Research Fields:**
  - Industrial Organization
  - Health Economics
  - Public Economics
  - Applied Microeconomics
